Why there is a weight discrepancy pop up on my screen?," Weight discrepancy arises when there's a difference between the weight given by the seller and the courier company.

The base factor to calculate the volumetric weight might vary for different courier partners.  Applied Weight: It is higher of two weights entered by the user i.e entered and volumetric weight on which the shipping charges are calculated.
